# GPTWEET

## What is a tweet anyways? 

Well, it's part of a conversation. But wouldn't it be nice if tweets read like conversations? 

## Gptweet cleans up tweets, and helps you visualize the entire conversation

### Step 1 

Input your twitter handle, and modify the options which will determine which tweets are fetched. 

### Step 2

Select which tweets you would like to process.

### Step 3 

We will generate a prompt for you, and at this stage you can fine tune your prompt with different styles, themes, 
and even input your own options. 

### Step 4

We will send your tweets to GPT, and it will return up to four "stories", which are conversations that have been generated 
using your tweets!

This can be a great way to summarize long threads, or get an idea of a conversation that is happening on twitter. Feel free
to get creative with the options!
